# Module 61 - Lab 23: Deploy RabbitMQ and Flower on a remote server

You will deploy a remote task processing environment using Docker Compose. The setup includes a RabbitMQ message broker, a Celery worker to execute background jobs, and a Flower dashboard to monitor the task queue in real-time. Finally, you will expose the local Flower interface to the public internet securely using a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel.

![Lab 23 Architecture Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/lab23-architecture.svg)

## Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| RabbitMQ | A robust message broker that receives, stores, and routes tasks to workers. |
| Flower | A web-based tool for monitoring and administrating Celery clusters. |
| Cloudflare Tunnel | A secure connection that exposes local services to the internet without opening inbound firewall ports. |

RabbitMQ receives task requests and coordinates delivery to the Celery worker process. The worker executes background tasks asynchronously and reports status events back to RabbitMQ. Flower consumes these events to compile live cluster metrics. Cloudflare Quick Tunnel establishes an outbound encrypted tunnel from the server to Cloudflare's edge network, granting secure external browser access to the Flower UI without public IP exposure or port forwarding.

## Objectives

- Build a `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate RabbitMQ, Celery Worker, and Flower.
- Implement a background Celery task in Python.
- Configure Cloudflare Tunnel to expose the Flower dashboard.
- Verify the successful execution of tasks via the command line and Flower UI.

## What You Will Build

```text
lab23-rabbitmq-flower/
├── docker-compose.yml
└── worker/
    └── tasks.py
```
You will build a multi-container environment where a Python worker executes background tasks delivered through RabbitMQ, while Flower monitors the task lifecycle.

## Step 1: Create the lab directories

Run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/lab23-rabbitmq-flower/worker
cd ~/lab23-rabbitmq-flower
```

![Create Directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image.png)

**Explanation:**
- `mkdir -p .../worker`: Creates the project directory and a nested `worker` directory for the Celery tasks.
- `cd ...`: Changes into the project root directory.

## Step 2: Define the Docker Compose configuration

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following contents:

```bash
cat > docker-compose.yml <<'EOF'
services:

  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3-management
    container_name: lab23-rabbitmq
    hostname: rabbitmq
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: celery
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: celery123
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"
      - "15672:15672"
    volumes:
      - rabbitmq_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq

  worker:
    image: python:3.11-slim
    container_name: lab23-worker
    working_dir: /app
    command: >
      sh -c "pip install -q celery &&
      celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info"
    environment:
      CELERY_BROKER_URL: amqp://celery:celery123@rabbitmq:5672//
    volumes:
      - ./worker:/app
    depends_on:
      - rabbitmq

  flower:
    image: mher/flower:2.0
    container_name: lab23-flower
    restart: unless-stopped
    command:
      - "celery"
      - "--broker=amqp://celery:celery123@rabbitmq:5672//"
      - "flower"
      - "--port=5555"
    ports:
      - "5555:5555"
    depends_on:
      - rabbitmq

volumes:
  rabbitmq_data:
EOF
```

![Create Docker Compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(2).png)

**Explanation:**
- `rabbitmq`: Runs the RabbitMQ server with the management plugin enabled, mapping required ports and setting default credentials.
- `flower`: Runs the Flower monitoring tool, connecting to the RabbitMQ broker, and mapping port 5555.
- `worker`: Uses a lightweight Python image to install Celery at runtime and start a worker process that looks for a `tasks` module.
- `volumes: rabbitmq_data`: Defines a persistent storage volume so messages are not lost upon container restart.

## Step 3: Create the Celery tasks file

Run the following command to create the task definitions inside the `worker` directory:

```bash
cat > worker/tasks.py <<'EOF'
import time
from celery import Celery

app = Celery(
    "tasks",
    broker="amqp://celery:celery123@rabbitmq:5672//",
    backend="rpc://",
)

@app.task
def add(x, y):
    time.sleep(2)
    return x + y
EOF
```

![Create Tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(3).png)

Run the following command to verify the directory structure:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 2 -type f -print
```

![Verify Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(4).png)

**Explanation:**
- `app = Celery(...)`: Initializes a Celery application using RabbitMQ as the broker and RPC as the backend.
- `@app.task`: Registers `add` as a background task.
- `find . -maxdepth 2 -type f -print`: Lists all files in the current directory and immediate subdirectories to confirm `docker-compose.yml` and `worker/tasks.py` exist.

## Step 4: Validate and start the services

Run the following command to validate the compose file:

```bash
docker compose config
```

![Validate Compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(5).png)

Run the following command to start the services in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

![Start Services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(6).png)

Run the following command to check the running containers:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

![Check Containers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(7).png)

Run the following command to view the worker logs and ensure it connected successfully:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=50 worker
```

![Check Worker Logs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(8).png)

**Explanation:**
- `docker compose config`: Validates and views the parsed Compose file.
- `docker compose up -d`: Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service in detached mode.
- `docker compose ps`: Lists the containers and their current status.
- `docker compose logs --tail=50 worker`: Outputs the last 50 lines of logging information specific to the worker container. (You may see retry attempts until RabbitMQ is fully ready).

## Verification

Run the following command to dispatch a task to the Celery worker:

```bash
docker compose exec worker python -c "from tasks import add; r=add.delay(10,20); print('Task ID:', r.id)"
```

**Expected output:**
```text
Task ID: [UUID string]
```

![Send Task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(9).png)

Run the worker logs command again to verify the task execution:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=50 worker
```

![Verify Task Logs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(10).png)

## Step 5: Download and configure Cloudflare Tunnel

To monitor tasks via Flower remotely, run the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/lab23-rabbitmq-flower
curl -L --output cloudflared https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64
chmod +x cloudflared
```

![Download Cloudflared](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(11).png)

**Explanation:**
- `curl -L --output cloudflared ...`: Downloads the latest Linux binary for `cloudflared` from GitHub.
- `chmod +x cloudflared`: Adds execution permissions to the downloaded binary so it can be run as a program.

## Step 6: Start the Cloudflare Tunnel

Run the following command to initiate the tunnel:

```bash
./cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5555
```

![Start Tunnel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(12).png)

*(Note: Running `docker compose config`, `docker compose up -d` and `docker compose ps` in a new terminal, as seen below, can be done to simply verify services are still running correctly without disruption.)*

![Check Config Again 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(13).png)
![Check Config Again 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(14).png)

To access the Flower dashboard and verify task completion, open the generated `https://<tunnel-id>.trycloudflare.com` URL (provided in the `cloudflared` terminal output) in your web browser.

- Navigate to the **Tasks** tab (or visit `https://<tunnel-id>.trycloudflare.com/tasks`) to see the executed task.

![Flower Tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iftakhar-323/lab-assets/main/lab23/Pasted%20image%20(15).png)

- Navigate to the **Workers** tab (or visit `https://<tunnel-id>.trycloudflare.com/workers`) to see the active worker node.

### Verification Summary
